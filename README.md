# Java & Object-Oriented Programming â€“ Training Examples

This repository contains code examples and exercises used in a **Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** training session I delivered to my coworkers.

The goal of the training was to strengthen understanding of Java fundamentals and core OOP principles through practical, hands-on learning.

## About the Training

The training covered:
- Java language basics
- Object-oriented concepts and best practices
- How to design, structure, and implement maintainable code in Java
- Practical examples to reinforce theory

Each `.java` file in this repository focuses on a specific topic, keeping the examples clear and self-contained.

## Topics Covered

- **Java Basics**
  - Variables and data types
  - Control structures (`if`, `switch`, loops)
  - Methods and parameter passing
  - Arrays and collections

- **OOP Fundamentals**
  - Classes and objects
  - Encapsulation (getters, setters, access modifiers)
  - Inheritance and composition
  - Polymorphism and method overriding
  - Abstraction with abstract classes and interfaces

- **Advanced OOP Concepts**
  - Constructors and overloading
  - Static members and constants
  - `final` keyword usage
  - Inner classes
  - Best practices for class design

- **Java-Specific Features**
  - `toString()`, `equals()` and `hashCode()`
  - Working with `List`, `Map`, and `Set`
  - Exception handling (`try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`)
  - Packages and imports
